# Calculator
A simple calculator that performs the four basic mathematical operations.

##How does it works?
<div style="background-color: gray; padding: 10px;">
  - The input value is treated as a string.
  - The `onclick` function is applied to add the key value to the input string.
  - The last value of the input is deleted if "DE" is clicked, or everything is deleted if "AC" is clicked.
  - The `eval` function is triggered if the equal sign is clicked. This converts the string into a mathematical expression and displays the result.
</div>
